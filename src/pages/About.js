            Full Stack Web Developer

            Hi, I'm Eric. I'm a full stack developer with a passion for education and working with communities. Utilizing my experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React, I have built applications that streamline file sharing for teachers and track consumersâ€™ usages. My background includes serving as a general education teacher and intervention specialist, as well as having a proven ability to manage and develop programs, staff, and budgets, effectively increasing revenue of non-profit organizations. As a developer, I hope to contribute to companies that invest in their communities, foster a diverse environment, and maintain a healthy fiscal and social approach.
