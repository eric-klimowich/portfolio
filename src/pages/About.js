      <p>
        Hi, I'm Eric. I'm a full stack developer with a passion for creating stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to programming, I spent 16 years in the not-for-profit world and a year in education.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these roles were people focused and I've brought that people-first mentality with me to the tech world. Overlap between program management, teaching, planning, and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I love going to sporting events, running, other stuff. Otherwise, I'm probably snuggling with my cats, Jack, Walter, Penny, and Olivia.
      </p>
